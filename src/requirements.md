- Intro Slider Component: Missing real content and images
- Main Navigation Bar: Incomplete active icon highlighting
- Home Page Component: Insufficient implementation of infinite scrolling and data fetching
- Abaya Item Component: Incomplete like status storage in IndexedDB
- Draggable Theme Slider Component: Lack of real-time theme changes and persistence
- Marketing/Referral Page: Incomplete reward system implementation
- FAQ Page: Missing dynamic loading of FAQs from backend
- IndexedDB Setup: Incomplete data preloading and migration handling
- Referral System Component: Insufficient backend integration for code validation and reward distribution
- Theme Switcher Component: Lack of smooth transitions between themes
- Localization: Incomplete Arabic text content and dynamic language switching
- PWA Compatibility: Insufficient offline functionality and caching strategies
- Additional UX Considerations: Incomplete accessibility features and error handling
